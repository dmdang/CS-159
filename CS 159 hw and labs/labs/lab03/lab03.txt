*
*  Program Description: The purpose of this program is to calculate the Nitrogen Oxide and Carbon Monoxide emissions for a vehicle. The user will be asked which emission they want to calculate and they will then enter the number of miles the vehicle has travelled. The total emissions will be displayed in grams.
